\section{Neural Network}

TODO: explain that the name is misleading.

Gridcoin uses a distributed system to come to a consensus how much work was done by each user. For this each node (Gridcoin client) asks each BOINC project server, what  the current RAC of each member of team Gridcoin is. Using the Google Distributed File System (GDFS) the nodes exchange the information regarding which user has done how much work. This information is hashed, so each node does not see the exact information from each other node, but the hash can be compared and it can be found out, if the hash of this node is the same as the majority hash of all nodes.

To become a part of the Neural Network, a researcher?s Gridcoin client has to send a ?beacon? containing the CPID and the wallet?s address. This is a transaction with a very small amount of Gridcoins, that links  the CPID  and wallet-address of this researcher in  its meta-information, so that this information is now forever stored in the blockchain.
