\section{Outlook}

TODO: gridcoin funded research

Commercial Projects: If it is possible to reward users for running specific code on their computers with cryptocurrency, they could also run commercial simulations on their computers basically for free as they are already rewarded by the newly generated cryptocurrency. This would make it possible to offer computing-intensive services much cheaper than is possible now.

Pool mining: Making it possible for users to earn Gridcoins by only pointing their BOINC client at the email address of a pool
