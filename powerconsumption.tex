\subsection{Gridcoin Power Consumption estimate}

We start to calculate the consumption of Gridcoin closest relative, Bitcoin. We follow the approach outlined in [27] for the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Calculate total mining revenues
	\item Estimate what part is spent in electricity
	\item Find out how much miners pay per kWh
	\item Convert costs to consumption
\end{itemize}

The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index assumes that miners will ultimately spend 60\% of their revenues on operational costs on average. For every 5 cents that were spent on operational costs it is assumed that 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) was consumed. [27]\\

Price movements can be small or large, but new energy-hungry machines won't all appear overnight. Realistic behaviour is introduced by linking price dynamics to the expected time required for producers to fully respond to a changing situation. [27]
