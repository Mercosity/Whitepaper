This whitepaper describes how Gridcoin makes it possible to reward running scientific simulations with cryptocurrency in a completely decentralized way. Gridcoin is heavily based on Bitcoin [1] with the outstanding exception that Proof of Work where energy is wasted in inverting a hash function is replaced with the novel approach of Proof of Stake [2] linked to Distributed Proof of Research [3], developed on purpose for gridcoin. The voting mechanism embedded in the blockchain which allows to choose which scientific projects to include in Proof of Research is outlined. In conclusion, an outlook is given on how Gridcoin could complement the way science is funded, sparking competition between traditionally funded science and gridcoin funded science.
